Hello.  Nice to meet you.  My name is Mamie Smith.
I became interested in creating a website after learning how to make costume jewelry.
Intitally the jewelry was just for me.  It had gotten too frustrating looking for jewelry
that retained its rich color once I put it on, and the color choices and styles were also limited (in my opinion).
Then for Christmas 2003 I went home to Louisiana.  Four of my Sisters and I were catching up and I showed 
them the necklace, bracelets and earring sets I'd made and selected to wear with the outfit I would  wear to the semi-formal dance.
The night of the dance as we were dressing, all four of my Sisters asked to "borrow" a particular set of jewelry if I wasn't going to wear it.  I agreed and was assured I'd get my jewelry back the next day.
The last day of our visit arrived but my jewelry hadn't returned.  I politely pulled each Sister aside and reminded her to return my jewelry back.
Each responded "what jewelry?", dropped $40 in my hand, and went about back to whatever she was doing.  
I was very pleasantly surprized, but didn't protest.
